Python console program that will crawl all links from one url.
You need to have Python 3 !
On Linux - Go to the terminal and write python3 crawl_links_by_url.py     (or what ever is your path)
On Windows - Go to the command line and write py crawl_links_by_url.py    (or what ever is your path)
Enjoy :)
